<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

I love doing quizzes, puzzles and all-things problem-solving. I've really 
enjoyed the Stuff Quizzes for a long time and will continue to do so. In
a recent update to the stuff.co.nz website, access to the quizzes was blocked 
by a sign-in prompt, which I found to be a nuisance as a user without an
account.

After a quick examination of the sign-in prompt HTML, I was able to identify
that it's possible to hide the sign-in prompt by hiding a few HTML elements.
I also noticed that there was no Javascript running in the background that
prevented this, and that the entire page content (including the quiz pane) 
was loaded on the initial page-load. I immediately determined that these
quick few steps to hide the sign-in prompt would become increasingly tedious
each time I visited the site to complete a quiz, which lead to me create this
simple Google Chrome Extension that does these actions for you.

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
